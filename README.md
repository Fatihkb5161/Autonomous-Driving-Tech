# Autonomous Driving Tech

This repository contains a collection of **mini-projects and assignments** developed within the scope of **Autonomous Driving Technologies** education.

The projects focus on fundamental concepts used in modern autonomous and advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS), including motion planning, control, sensor fusion, functional safety, and clean software design.

All studies were implemented as part of university coursework and specialization programs, with an emphasis on **conceptual understanding, modeling, and clean implementation**.
